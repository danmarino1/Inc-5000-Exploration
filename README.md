Inc 5000 Exploration

Description

This project is an exploratory data analysis of the 2022 Inc. 5000. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data, using Python to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. The data was scraped from the Inc. 5000 website using a request to their API and the JSON data was cleaned for analysis.

What is your project?
The project is a data analysis of the Inc. 5000 list for the year 2022. It uses Python and several libraries to process and visualize the data. The data was collected by making a request to the Inc. 5000 API and the returned JSON data was cleaned and transformed into a pandas DataFrame for analysis. The project is deployed as a Streamlit application.

Usage examples
The main script of the project is inc5000dash.py, which can be run to start the analysis process. The script includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of the Inc. 5000 data.

Issues or limitations of the project
As the project is based on the 2022 Inc. 5000 data, it may not be applicable or accurate for other years or datasets. The data was scraped from the Inc. 5000 website and any changes to their API or data structure could affect the functionality of the project.

Future features
Future updates may include analysis for different years, additional visualization features, and improvements to the data cleaning process.
